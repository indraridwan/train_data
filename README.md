Project Description: YOLOv5 Object Detection with Custom Data Using Roboflow in Google Colab

This project demonstrates how to train a custom object detection model using YOLOv5 in Google Colab with a dataset provided by Roboflow. It covers the entire process, from dataset preparation to training the model and deploying it for real-world applications.

Steps:
Dataset Preparation:

Upload a custom dataset (e.g., pets, cans) to Roboflow.
Roboflow handles dataset preprocessing and augmentation, and exports the data in the required YOLOv5 format.
Model Training Setup:

Use Google Colab to train the YOLOv5 model.
Import necessary libraries like YOLOv5, PyTorch, and Roboflow.
Roboflow Integration:

Use the Roboflow API to load the dataset into the Colab notebook.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets and apply data augmentation.
Training YOLOv5 Model:

Train the model using Colab's GPU.
Choose the appropriate YOLOv5 model (e.g., yolov5s) and set training parameters.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision).
Validate the model’s performance on unseen data.
Inference:

Use the trained model to detect objects in new images or videos.
Export and Deployment:

Save the trained model and export it to formats like ONNX or TensorFlow for deployment.
Benefits:
Roboflow: Simplifies dataset preparation and annotation.
Google Colab: Provides free GPU for training without requiring local hardware.
YOLOv5: Fast, accurate, and deployable to edge devices, cloud, or web applications.
By the end of this project, you’ll have a trained YOLOv5 model ready to detect custom objects like pets or cans for real-world use.
